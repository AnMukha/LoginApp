#### Install PostgreSQL database 

It should be MySQL but I didn't have time to change

1. DB connection string:
"DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost:5432;Database=***;Username=***;Password=***"
  
2. SigningKey:
"SigningKey": "...................some long enough string to be a signing key........................"

In console of this application and in consoles of services you will see information about authentication in Identity service throw GeteWay service and sending message to PostLogin service.

### Explanations

The backend microservice architecture contains GateWay (Ocelot) with two API methods - for authentication and sending of post-login message.
The client application is authorized and sends a post-login message with the received token.
All communications, including the client-GateWay, work via http (didnâ€™t have time to check if https works).
User authentication is verified on GateWay, the network behind GateWay is considered secure and service communications are not protected.
Error handling in services is organized by adding a new item to midleware.

The LoginApp.RestServicesCore project was also created to create a common basis for describing Rest services, but this project just implements the creation of a service without the capabilities of a flexible builder. There was not enough time to create a full-fledged framework supporting the concern list.
